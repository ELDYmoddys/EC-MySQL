# What's EC?

EC is an open-source Discord digital currency and transaction bot written by eldym. It makes use of Python, discord.py, and MySQL.
It is designed for ease of use and quick deployment in mind, and works as a form of learning to introduce Oracle's MySQL database software alongside the Python programming language.

This project aims to demonstrate the oppurtunities of MySQL through the use of a fun bot that can be deployed and/or modified by anyone at home.

# NOTICE: Core features have been completed!

Yippee! EC's main features have been completed! 
However, more planned features are on their way! 
Please stay tuned for continued updates.

A guide will later be provided *here* when I feel that the code is ready to ship!

Thanks!
