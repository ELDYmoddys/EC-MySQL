# PLEASE NOTE!

This project is currently a WIP!
In it's current state, the bot is missing key features in order to function as intended.
Please stay tuned for updates and eventual completion.

A guide will later be provided *here* when the code is operational!

Thanks!

# What's EC?

EC is an open-source Discord digital currency bot making use of Python and MySQL's storage solutions written by eldym.
It is designed for ease of use and as a form of learning to introduce MySQL alongside the Python programming language.

By leveraging the strengths of accessing data and storing it with MySQL, use of the 'discord.py' API wrapper can make easy to use the Python MySQL Connector to keep a Discord user's data easily accessible.  As such, this project aims to demonstrate the oppurtunities of MySQL through the use of a fun basic but adjustable currency bot that can be quickly deployed or modified by anyone at home.
