# PLEASE NOTE!

Yippee! Core features have been completed! 
However, more planned features are on their way! 
Please stay tuned for continued updates.

# What's EC?

EC is an open-source Discord digital currency bot making use of Python and MySQL's storage solutions written by eldym.
It is designed for ease of use and as a form of learning to introduce MySQL alongside the Python programming language.

By leveraging the strengths of accessing data and storing it with MySQL, use of the 'discord.py' API wrapper can make easy to use the Python MySQL Connector to keep a Discord user's data easily accessible.  As such, this project aims to demonstrate the oppurtunities of MySQL through the use of a fun basic but adjustable currency bot that can be quickly deployed or modified by anyone at home.
